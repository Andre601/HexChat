# HexChat
*HexChat is a chat plugin that implements support for HEX colors to customize your chat beyond the usual color and formatting codes.*

The plugin utilizes the new option to colorize the chat in any hex color imaginable (Spigot 1.16+ only).  
Just put a `#` followed by a hexadecimal code in chat and it will change the color of the chat after it (When you have permissions.
