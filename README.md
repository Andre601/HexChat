# HexChat
*HexChat is a chat plugin that implements support for HEX colors to customize your chat beyond the usual color and formatting codes.*

The plugin utilizes the new option to colorize the chat in any hex color imaginable (Spigot 1.16+ only).  
Just use `#` followed by the hexadecimal value of a color in the `color:` option of the config, to set the color to any you can imagine.

But this isn't all!  
The plugin also supports JSON actions such as hover and click actions.

Please check the [Spigot page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hexchat.80696/) for more information.
